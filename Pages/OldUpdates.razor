<h1>Old Updates</h1>


<h2>6/30/2019</h2>
<p>Fixed a bug that caused some buttons to not render properly.</p>
<p>Fixed a bug that made it impossible to see all the areas if your screen was too small.</p>
<p>Made the follower menu available everywhere.</p>
<p>The game now tells you how much of an item you have stored in the bank with each follower trip.</p>
<p>I'll be going on vacation tomorrow from the 1st to the 5th, so there won't be any updates while I'm gone, but I will be working on the next content update so that will hopefully be out not too long after I come back!</p>


<h2>6/29/2019</h2>
<p>Fixed some typos.</p>
<p>Fixed a bug where some arrows were only creatable by using the metal tip rather than the arrow shaft.</p>
<p>Fixed a bug where losing a boost while mining would prevent players from ever stopping.</p>
<p>Combat has been changed slightly. Strengths and weaknesses play slightly less of an effect on damage, monsters weak to something now block using 1/3 armor instead of none, and base strength plays less into the calculation for damage overall.</p>
<p>If you find combat to be too difficult or nerfed too hard, please let me know. I'm open to finding a good middleground.</p>

<h2>6/28/2019</h2>
<p>Old updates logs have been moved to a different page to make this page far less long.</p>
<p>Pigeon jerky now can be properly removed from the tannery.</p>
<p>Autosmithing has been completely reworked! Just select a bar type and an item you would like to make. Let me know how it works for you.</p>
<p>The UI has been updated again! Let me know how this works for you, it might be a little less usable on very small screens, I'm not sure though.</p>
<p>The game now remembers your withdraw X value at the bank.</p>
<p>Archery now affects your hunting slightly. Every 10 levels increases your minimum catch by 1. It may become more intertwined in the future, but for now let me know how it works for you.</p>
<p>Totem pole droprates have been slightly nerfed.</p>
<p>Fixed a bug that checked for the wrong level when selecting an item while autosmithing.</p>

<h2>6/27/2019</h2>
<p>Save imports and exports now work correctly with stored salt, seaweed, and rice.</p>
<p>The game no longer breaks when leaving the sushi shop while making sushi.</p>
<p>Hunting now works offline! When you return the only area accessible to you should be the place you were hunting. Let me know how it works for you!</p>
<p>You can now hunt Big Moose, which have a unique drop of Big Moose Antlers. You can add them to a Moose Hat to look cooler!</p>
<p>Creating stackable items with a full inventory no longer makes you lose the materials but not get the item.</p>
<p>Maybe some hunting bugs have been fixed.</p>
<p>I have created a Patreon page. A few people have mentioned they would like a way to support me, and until I get the Kongregate API working this will be the only way. Thank you to anyone who feels like donating! <a href="https://www.patreon.com/billybillyjim" target="_blank">Patreon</a></p>

<h2>6/26/2019</h2>
<p>Fixed a bug that prevented withdrawing some kinds of meat from the tannery.</p>
<p>Fixed a bug that let players withdraw jerky even if they didn't have inventory space for it.</p>
<p>Fixed a bug that stopped players from gaining experience from harpoon fishing.</p>
<p>Maybe fixed scrolling propagation issues? I can't test it until it's actually live. Hopefully this doesn't break everything.</p>
<p>Experience gain from leathermaking and jerky making has been fixed to proper amounts.</p>
<p>Deftness now applies a slight damage boost to archery.</p>
<p>The skeletons in the graveyard are now strong to swords. I'm still on the fence about this change, so please let me know what you think!</p>

<h2>6/25/2019</h2>
<p>Fixed a bug that made locked items deposit in the bank and stay in your inventory at the same time.</p>
<p>Players can now equip and use items that are locked.</p>
<p>Shopkeepers will no longer take your money and not give you an item if you don't have the inventory space. The main perpetrator has been sacked and will not be seen around these parts again.</p>
<p>The way totems work has been entirely changed.</p>
<p>Strength and Deftness training at the gym are now 2.5x more effective.</p>
<p>Another fishing exp/hr nerf.</p>
<p>A new area has been added to the game! A mysterious traveller heading towards Tsu City has some interesting information for you!</p>
<p>Harpoon fishing is now possible with two new fishing items. They grant a small experience bonus when used.</p>
<p>The new harpoon fishing area has a drop table with new fishing gear you can wear to increase your fishing experience gains.</p>
<p>The sushi shop Amante is now available to create sushi from! Just deposit your rice and seaweed there and you can do full inventories of sushi rolls while idling!</p>
<p>Soul Goods sells a variety of curiosities, including salt, which is required for tanning, and a yoga mat, which lets you train HP in the yoga garden in Tsu City.</p>
<p>Tammy's Tannery is now accessible! Leave your meats and hides there for a few hours with some salt, and you'll recieve leather in return!</p>
<p>Leatherworking can now be accomplished with leatherworking tools and leather. Leather items require multiple amounts of leather to be created, but provide armor and sometime damage boosts.</p>
<p>A new battle area is available in the graveyard near Tammy's Tannery. These monsters have very high HP and deal a high amount of damage, but with armor you can recieve some great drops from them.</p>
<p>The woodworker's association building is now accessible. Buy a number of low level woodworking goods here. It might not seem like much now, but there are plans in the works for this location.</p>
<p>Fixed a bug where players couldn't see the new NPC. Oops.</p>
<p>Fixed a bug where experience bonuses from armor weren't being applied correctly.</p>
<p>Fixed a bug where the sushi shop didn't work at all.</p>

<h2>6/24/2019</h2>
<p>The bank now remembers your sort style during each game session.</p>
<p>Hunting now yields fewer resources from higher levels than before.</p>
<p>You can now see your total level in the skills menu.</p>
<p>Items in your inventory can now be locked by clicking the lock by their name. This prevents using, equipping, eating, selling, and depositing them accidentally.</p>
<p>The game's UI should be a little less jumpy. I'm still trying to figure this css thing out.</p>
<p>Leatherworking appears as a skill now but you can't train it yet.</p>
<p>The content update is about half done. 3 more areas to complete!</p>
<p>A new NPC in the wind hall explains the area a little better.</p>
<p>Fixed a bug that caused some usable items to no longer work properly.</p>

<h2>6/23/2019</h2>
<p>Winning an autobattle should immediately update the UI now.</p>
<p>Version number now appears at the top of the screen in both split and regular view.</p>
<p>The game no longer crashes when you autosmith with a full inventory.</p>
<p>It appears that clicking load game too soon after the game loads can cause your game to load improperly. I'm trying to work on a fix, but in the mean time, if your save game disappears, try reloading the page and waiting for a second before clicking load game.</p>
<p>Monsters now have armor! I've tried to keep it low for current enemies, but some enemies in some areas will resist a lot of damage. Note that using an effective weapon ignores enemy armor.</p>

<h2>6/22/2019</h2>
<p>You can no longer leave the area while looking for an ore vein.</p>
<p>Various bug fixes.</p>
<p>Settings now save properly.</p>
<p>The game now saves an encrypted savefile along with the regular one, and tries to load the encrypted file first. In a few days the regular file will be removed.</p>
<p>A number of players have mentioned their game crashing while autosmithing, but I haven't been able to recreate it yet. Let me know if it happens to you.</p>
<p>Having a negative number of things no longer breaks your save.</p>
<p>Fish are now slightly slower to catch and nets now help slightly less for catching speed. The next big update will introduce other equipable gear to help compensate for this change.</p>
<p>More disabled buttons now tell you why they are disabled.</p>
<p>Food buffs no longer move your inventory around when they begin and end.</p>

<h2>6/21/2019</h2>
<p>You can no longer leave the area while auto battling.</p>
<p>Fixed some bugs involving getting negative amounts of items.</p>
<p>Begun work on the River Hoin update, which will include equipable things that aren't weapons, afk culinary arts training, a new skill, a new way to train HP, and some handy shops.</p>
<p>The settings menu no longer crashes the game.</p>
<p>With my recent Blazor update, bank search and withdraw x/sell x features had to be completely changed. </p>

<h2>6/20/2019</h2>
<p>Fixed some log texts so crafting arrows properly describes adding tips.</p>
<p>Changed the way a number of engine things work. Hopefully nothing broke, but it should fix some rare bugs involving double gathering/crafting.</p>
<p>Autosaving now appears in the ledger again. This will hopefully make it easier to tell if the system is actually working like it should.</p>
<p>Auto smithing is now possible with the right follower! I've really tried to bugtest this feature well, but it's a complicated process. Let me know if anything breaks!</p>
<p>Fixed a bug that made it impossible to smith with ore.</p>

<h2>6/19/2019</h2>
<p>Fixed a number of loading bugs caused by attempting to use the PlayFab API.</p>

<p>The early mining area now tells you the kinds of ores you can find in the area description.</p>
<p>I've added a local save and load option to the settings menu. It should work perfectly, but I can only test it so much before releasing it. Let me know if it works for you!</p>
<p>Auto smithing is almost ready! Just need to figure out one issue and it'll be ready for use. Thanks for waiting!</p>
<p>Fixed a pretty bad bug that would crash your game if you entered the smithy without any ores or bars in your bank.</p>

<h2>6/18/2019</h2>
<p>Added a message to players if save/load isn't working properly. Hopefully this lets people know before they waste time playing and losing a save file.</p>
<p>Made the sell menu in shops fit better on one line.</p>
<p>By request menu sections now have separate scroll wheels. Let me know if you like this change!</p>
<p>The skill info menus now gray out items you don't have the levels for yet.</p>
<p>Compact bank view is now a toggle in the settings menu.</p>

<p>Mousing over items in your inventory will now show their item descriptions.</p>

<p>People have been asking for a kongregate forum, but I believe it's up to Kongregate to grant those. In the mean time, I have made a subreddit over at /r/Quepland on Reddit.</p>
<p>I'm aware some people are having an issue with their saves. I think I've fixed it, but I can't reproduce the problem, so if it keeps happening let me know with as much information as you can. I'm sorry for any frustration this has caused.</p>
